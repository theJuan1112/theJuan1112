I am an Application Security Consultant. My main passion is supporting businesses and developers in creating and maintaining the most secure and robust software they can build.

I accomplish this by building AppSec programs, testing applications with DAST tools (ZAP/Burp), and doing code reviews with SAST tools (Semgrep/CodeQL).
